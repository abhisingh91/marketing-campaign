# marketing_campaign

🌐 The dataset shows customer behavior in response to different marketing campaigns <br> &emsp;&nbsp; Particularly focusing on whether customers made purchases in two different campaigns (Campaign A & Campaign B).

### 💪 Statistical analysis is performed on the data
- **Descriptive Stats**: To measure the central tendency and variability of continuous variables in the data
- **Inferential Stats**: Focusing on different hypothesis testing to add statistical rigor to the trends and visualization that we see in the data

### 🧪 Tests Used
- t-test: To compare the means of different groups containing continuous data
- chi-square test: To determine if there is any significant association between two categorical variables

<br>

**💡 The tests focus on finding the confirmations related to two fields**
1. *Age*: If there is significant age difference between different groups using t-tests
2. *Gender*: To find the associations of purchases in different campaigns with gender using chi-square tests
